RLPortfolio is a Python package which provides several features to implement, train and test reinforcement learning agents that optimize a financial portfolio:
- A training simulation environment that implements the state-of-the-art mathematical formulation commonly used in the research field.
- Two policy gradient policy gradient training algorithms that are specifically built to solve the portfolio optimization task.
- Four cutting-edge deep neural networks
