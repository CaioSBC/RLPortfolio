Installing the Library
======================

Currently, RLPortfolio can only be installed by cloning its github repository and running the setup script:

.. code-block:: console

   git clone https://github.com/CaioSBC/RLPortfolio
   cd RLPortfolio/
   pip install .

.. note::

    We strongly recommend that you setup a virtual environment using `Python venv <https://docs.python.org/3.10/library/venv.html>`_ or `Anaconda/Miniconda <https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install>`_ insted of installing RLPortfolio in your root Python.
    You can also setup a `Docker image <https://www.docker.com/>`_.
